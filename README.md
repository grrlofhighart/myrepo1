# Example Repo

This is a sample readme file for my GitHub example repo. I'm learning markdown.

* This is meant to be an example.
* Markdown is exceptionally fast.
* Amazing, right?

## Link Example
According to the GitHub docs, links are automatically created from standard URL's. You can read more about it here [Writing on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github)
